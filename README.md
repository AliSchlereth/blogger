A Rails New Tutorial

In this project you'll create a simple blog system and learn the basics of Ruby on Rails including:

* Models, Views, and Controllers (MVC)
* Data Structures & Relationships
* Routing
* Migrations
* Views with forms, partials, and helpers
* RESTful design

Check out the tutorial on Turing's Backend Engineering Website [here](http://backend.turing.io/module2/misc/blogger) or straight off of GitHub [here](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module2/misc/blogger.md)

### Finding the code you want to reference:
The master branch has completed functionality through Iter3. 
I've included branches for each piece of functionality along the way. If you're stuck on a particular part of the implementation I encourage you to take a look at the specific branch since later iterations might have impacted the code on the master branch. 



Happy Successes as you Rails New!
